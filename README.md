## Machine Learning by Python
---
### INTRODUCTION
  The project is developed for implementing various machine learning algorithms in Python from scratch. These algorithms encompass THREE parts:
1. **SUPERVISED LEARNING **
- KNN
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- SVM
- Adaboost

2. **UNSUPERVISED LEARNING**
- K-means
- Apriori
- FP-growth

3. **OTHER TOOLS**
- PCA
- SVD
- MapReduce
---
### REQUIREMENT
Python3, Numpy, Matplotlib
